## Built on Github Pages

I built this website using a mixture of templates, and then customized it.  I'm constantly updating, and tweaking it.

Some of the themes that I used:  
- [Carte-Noire](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/carte-noire), for my blog
- [Creative](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/creative-theme-jekyll), for my website
