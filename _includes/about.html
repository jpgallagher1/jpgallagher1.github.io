                    After graduating with a degree in economics, I started my career in quantitative finance.  From there I learned to take care of clients.  
                    <br/>
                    My latest work has broaded into general software development and data science. 
                    <br/>
                    I focus on communicating clear ideas.  I have experience in machine learning models, time series analysis, and presentation ready visuals.

                    <br/>
                    I help clients learn more from their data.  </p>
